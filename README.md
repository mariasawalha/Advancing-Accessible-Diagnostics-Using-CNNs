### A CNN-Based Model for Early Detection of Retinal and Corneal Eye Diseases

The proposed capstone project aims to investigate Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for detecting retinal and corneal eye diseases through computer vision. With the increasing frequency of eye-related conditions, early and accurate detection is essential for timely intervention. The hope is to develop accessible AI algorithms as a proof-of-concept, capable of identifying early signs of internal diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma, and external ones, such as conjunctivitis and cellulitis. Multiple specialized CNN algorithms will be developed, each tailored to detect a specific eye disease.

Leveraging CNNs to analyze visual patterns in eye images, each algorithm will provide diagnosis suggestions for individuals and ophthalmologists, especially in regions with limited healthcare access. This involves the development of a prototype within health-related computer vision applications, focusing on deep learning and its role in accessible diagnostics, and addressing a healthcare need with technological innovation. 

The increasing number of eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataracts, and age-related macular degeneration, presents a growing need for early and accessible diagnostic tools worldwide. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) integration into ophthalmology has significantly progressed. Out of many promising technologies, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven effective in diagnosing retinal and corneal eye diseases. 

Convolutional neural networks are deep learning models designed to process and analyze visual data, making them specifically useful for ophthalmological diagnostics. Their ability to process highly dimensional data allows them to extract complex features from retinal images, facilitating accurate disease detection (Rafay et al., 2023). CNNs work through a hierarchical series of layers: the initial layers detect simple features. In contrast, deeper ones capture the complex patterns that help differentiate between healthy and diseased tissues in the eye. This capacity to analyze subtle patterns mirrors the human optic system, making CNNs highly effective for detecting diseases like diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma (Du et al., 2024). CNNs have outperformed conventional diagnostic techniques because of their superior image recognition capabilities, especially in early disease identification, which is essential for avoiding illnesses that could cause permanent blindness (Han, 2022). 

The research goal is to develop specialized models for the early detection of eye diseases by leveraging CNNs' ability to analyze complex visual patterns. The literature review explores existing AI-driven models and their applications in ophthalmological disease detection, with a focus on convolutional neural networks. It will highlight the growth of AI in the field, the limitations of current technologies, and the gaps the project seeks to address, specifically in terms of accessibility, multi-modal detection, and employment in resource-limited environments.
