### A CNN-Based Model for Early Detection of Retinal and Corneal Eye Diseases

Vision impairment caused by retinal diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy, Glaucoma, and Age-Related Macular Degeneration poses a significant global health challenge, particularly in low-resource settings where access to early diagnostics is limited. This thesis proposes a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) ensemble framework to enable early and accurate detection of these conditions from fundus images. The model combines EfficientNetB0 and MobileNetV2 architectures with meta-classifiers, including XGBoost and Random Forest, to enhance classification performance while minimizing computational demand. A diverse and balanced dataset compiled from multiple public sources was used to train and evaluate the model, with extensive preprocessing techniques—such as green channel extraction, CLAHE, and data augmentation—applied to improve robustness. The ensemble achieved an overall accuracy of 85%, with high F1-scores and AUC-ROC values across all four classes. Results show the model’s strong ability to distinguish between retinal diseases, although challenges remain in separating visually similar conditions such as early-stage Diabetic Retinopathy and Normal eyes. This research demonstrates the potential of ensemble CNNs in delivering scalable, interpretable, and efficient diagnostic tools for ophthalmology, supporting broader efforts to reduce preventable blindness through accessible AI technologies.
